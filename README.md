# FRCScouter
The year is 20XX and all teams have a world class robot. Programmers have gotten so good at auto that they've phased out the need for skilled drivers. One thing is left to differentiate teams - their strategy.

Introducing the revolutionary tool which elevates your scouting to the next level - FRC Scouter (working name).

With FRC Scouter, match scouters can log down a robot's actions live with a GUI represention of the field. The app builds a timeline of these actions and scouters are able to view a team's strategy, the amount of time it takes for them to achieve an objective, how long it takes to complete the average scoring cycle, and that robot's estimated point contribution. All this, saved and organized within a scouting log. 

The future of scouting is (almost) here.
